## Welcome to the Neechy App Engine Demo.

This is a demo of the Neechy PHP wiki project. It is designed to run on the [Google PHP App Engine runtime environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/php/) and the code is available on [Github](https://github.com/klenwell/neechy-app-engine).

### Login and Start Editing

Login by clicking the login button in the navbar and using your Google account. Once you log in, you can start editing wiki pages. Neechy Wiki supports an extended markdown syntax. For more information, see the [NeechyFormatting page](/page/NeechyFormatting).

### Developers

Neechy is designed to allow you, as a developer, to hack on your own wiki. Extend existing features and add your own. For more information, visit the [Neechy Github site](https://github.com/klenwell/neechy).
